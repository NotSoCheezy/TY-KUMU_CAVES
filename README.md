# Ty the Tasmanian Tiger - Kumu Caves Restored
Welcome to Kumu Caves!

To use this mod, first install ty-mod-manager here: https://github.com/Dnawrkshp/ty-1-tools. Then, drag the files into your Mods folder and activate the mod in the mod loader.

Shadow's home is finally restored to its former glory! Find the portal at the end of the path near Julius' lab.

Special thanks to Koushi's rkvMT, Dnawrkshp's ty-1-tools, and Hidden Palace's Project Deluge! Without you, this would not have been possible!
